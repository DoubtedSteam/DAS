In this work, we propose a novel and affordable solution for vision-language instruction tuning, namely Mixture-of-Modality Adaptation (MMA). 
Particularly, MMA is an end-to-end optimization regime, which connects the image encoder  and LLM via lightweight adapters.   Meanwhile, we also   propose a novel routing algorithm in MMA, which can   help the model automatically shifts the  reasoning paths  for single- and multi-modal instructions.  Based on MMA, we develop a large vision-language instructed model called LaVIN, which demonstrates superior training efficiency and  better reasoning ability  than existing multimodal LLMs in various instruction-following tasks.

## News 
- **`2023/06/30`**: ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ With very limited training data and cost, LaVIN achieves 5-th place of Perception and Cognition on [MME benchmark](https://github.com/BradyFU/Awesome-Multimodal-Large-Language-Models/tree/Evaluation)ï¼Œ outperforming seven existing multimodal LLMs. Evaluation codes are available.

## Setup
### Install Package 
```bash
conda create -n lavin python=3.8 -y
conda activate lavin

# install pytorch
conda install pytorch==1.12.1 torchvision==0.13.1 torchaudio==0.12.1 -c pytorch

# install dependency and lavin
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
```
### Data Preparation
- For ScienceQA, please prepare the dataset from the [official repo](https://github.com/lupantech/ScienceQA).
- For Multimodal Chatbot, download the images in _train2014_ split from [MSCOCO](http://images.cocodataset.org/zips/train2014.zip), and obtain the prepared 52k text-only and 158k text-image instruction-following data from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gORDPruqwXbgy6NYmhpDXO7t089yzsg3/view?usp=share_link).
- Obtain the weights of LLaMA from [this form](https://forms.gle/jk851eBVbX1m5TAv5)  (official) or Download [LLaMA-7B](https://huggingface.co/nyanko7/LLaMA-7B/tree/main) and [LLaMA-13B](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/llama-13b) from HuggingFace (unofficial).
- If you want to use Vicuna weights to initialize the model, please download from [here](https://huggingface.co/lmsys).
After that, the file structure should look like:

```bash

## Fine-tuning
### ScienceQA
Reproduce the performance of LaVIN-7B on ScienceQA.
For 7B model, we fine-tune it on 2x A100 (we find that the performance will be affected by the number of GPUs. We are working to address this problem).


LLaMA weights:
```bash
bash ./scripts/finetuning_sqa_7b.sh
```

Vicuna weights:
```bash
bash ./scripts/finetuning_sqa_vicuna_7b.sh
```

LaVIN-lite with LLaMA weights (single GPU):
```bash
bash ./scripts/finetuning_sqa_vicuna_7b_lite.sh
```

Reproduce the performance of LaVIN-13B on ScienceQA (~2 hours on 8x A100 (80G)).
For 13B model, we fine-tune it on 8x A100.

LLaMA weights:
```bash
bash ./scripts/finetuning_sqa_13b.sh
```

Vicuna weights:
```bash
bash ./scripts/finetuning_sqa_vicuna_13b.sh
```
LaVIN-lite with LLaMA weights (single GPU):
```bash
bash ./scripts/finetuning_sqa_vicuna_13b_lite.sh
```
### MultiModal ChatBot
Fine-tune LaVIN-13B on 210k instruction-following data (~ 75 hours with 15 epochs and ~25 hours with 5 epochs on 8x A100 (80G) )

LLaMA weights:
```bash
bash ./scripts/vl_instruction_tuning_13b.sh
```

Vicuna weights:
```bash
bash ./scripts/vl_instruction_tuning_vicuna_13b.sh
```
To train on fewer GPUs, you can reduce the number of gpus in the scripts and increase gradient accumulation via ```--accum_iter``` to guarantee the total batch size of 32. Setting  ```--gradient_checkpointing```  and ```--bits 4bit``` in the scripts will greatly reduce the requirements of GPU memory.


## Demo

LaVIN supports both single- and multi-modal instruction inputs. Try your custom instructions in our demo:

- **Launch a gradio web server on your machine, then you can interact with LaVIN as you like.** 
```
torchrun --nproc_per_node 1 demo.py --server_name 127.0.0.1
```
